This is the preliminary version of three of the game's main weapons: the energy beam, the kinetic particle cannon and the missile launcher.

To use, unzip the file into whatever folder is convenient within the Unity project you're working in. In the Resources folder (don't rename this folder! Some of the scripts depend on it) are several prefabs. Three of them are labeled "WEAPON - weapon type". If you attach one of these to a ship object in the game, the ship will then be equipped with that weapon and ready to use it in-game. You must, however, provide a target to shoot at in the Inspector to the prefab's script once you've attached it.

Once the prefab has been attached and its script given a target, press Play and use the "Fire" button in the script in the Inspector to fire the weapon.

I'm not crazy about a few of the textures right now but these prefabs are totally open and can have new textures assigned to them. If you find a better glowing charge ball effect for the energy beam, or like a different missile texture, feel free to use it instead, and it should work immediately.
